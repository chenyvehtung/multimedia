# HTML

The most stupid homework I have ever met for all this year.

It is a homework for the **graduate student**, aim to use as most html label as possible. Nothing more, nothing less.

Sometimes live goes like this, no matter you like it or not, you just have to do it, even though you know it is really a waste of time.
